Chitter is a Single Page Application (SPA) for the front end of a Twitter-type application.
Making it a Single Page Application offers several advantages over traditional multi-page applications (MPAs) and server-side rendered (SSR) applications.

## Advantages of SPA over MPA:
1.  Seamless and responsive User Experience by dynamically updating content without full page reloads. This results in  faster navigation and smoother interactions.
2.	Faster Load Times - SPAs load all necessary assets initially and then fetches data from the server as needed
3.  Improved Performance - SPAs use client-side rendering, offloading processing to the user's browser rather than the server

## Disadvantages of SPA over MPA:
1.	Initial Load Time can be longer due to the need to download and execute JavaScript bundles
2. Susceptability to security vulnerabilities as SPAs rely heavily on client-side code
3. Browser Compatibility, especially for devices that don't support modern JavaScript features
